# DeepConvolution-Q-Learning
The Atari Gymnasium Pacman environment involves navigating a maze, collecting pellets, and avoiding ghosts. A Deep Q-Learning (DQN) model was applied, using techniques like experience replay, target networks, and reward shaping to optimize performance. The model effectively learned strategies to maximize scores by balancing risk .
